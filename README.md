# Test-Driven Development by Example
A repository to put into practice the concepts provided in the Test-Driven Development by Example book by Kent Beck.

# To-do list
Kent says we should have an ongoing to-do list of the behaviors we want our system to have. If implementing them in clean code is too troublesome right now, we should add these refactorings as further to-dos, to instead focus on getting the tests green as quickly as possible.

I'll be updating the to-do list as I go through the chapters in the book. If you wish to see its progress, check the git history of commits. :)

* $5 + 10CHF = $10 if rate is 2:1
* ~~$5 * 2 = $10~~
* Make "amount" private
* Dollar side-effects?
* Money rounding?
