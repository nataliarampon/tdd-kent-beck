## To-do list
I'll be updating the to-do list as I go through the chapters in the book. If you wish to see its progress, check the git history of commits. :)

* Invoke test method
* Invoke setUp first
* Invoke tearDown afterward
* Invoke tearDown even if the test method fails
* Run multiple tests
* Report collected results
